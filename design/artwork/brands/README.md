# Brands

The `/design/artwork/brands` folder contains various type of files to be used for denoting any kind of brands (in the broad sense of the term: commercial, popular, but also strictly personal).

## Portable

The `/design/artwork/brands/portable` folder contains `png` images intended to be used in different pages, but also especially the _icons_ used as shortcuts (_ie._ _favicons_) in the `<head>` of each pages of the site.

Because these images are truly binary, they are ignored in the versioning control system.

## Scalable

The `/design/artwork/brands/scalable` folder contains `svg` files intended to be used in different pages. These files can be fully inner generated items in order to be used in the project or directly pulled from the [Simple Icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons) project.

As these images are considered as text files, they are included in the versioning control system.

(At this time, the process follows mainly steps described in [_Contributing to Simple Icons_](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-or-updating-an-icon) guidelines.)
